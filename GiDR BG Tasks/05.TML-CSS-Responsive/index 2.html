        <h2><img src="images/Gaudi-Sagrada-Familia-155.jpg" alt="Sagrada Familia">Antonio Gaudi</h2>
        <p>The voices of Barcelona blur in a mix of Spanish and Catalan in much the way Gaudi's work blurs the lines between architecture and artwork. </p>
        <p>From the  tiled benches in Guell Park to the towers over Casa Mila and Casa Battl&oacute;, I fell in love with Goudi's work on my first trip to Barcelona.</p>

    <div id="article2">
        <h2><img src="images/Park-Guell-bench-155.jpg" alt="Park Guell">Park Guell</h2>
        <p>The benches  as Lizard fountain in Park Guell make up part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site  know as, &quot;The Works of Antonio Gaudi.&quot;</p>
        <p>The park features Gaudi's famous Lizard Fountain, as well as benches and other extraordinary examples of Gaudi's talent with tiles.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="article3">
        <h2><img src="images/Casa-Battlo-155.jpg" alt="Casa Batlló">Casa Batll&oacute;</h2>
        <p>The first  time I strolled down the Passeig de Gr&aacute;cia (Catalan for the Promenade of  Grace), I stopped in my tracks in front of Gaudi's Casa Batlló.</p>
        <p>The 'house,' wedged between two 'normal' buildings, looks more like a giant sculpture than any house I'd ever seen anywhere else. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="article4">
        <h2><img src="images/Cala-Mila-155.jpg" alt="Casa Mila">Casa Mila</h2>
        <p>A popular attraction  in Barcelona, Casa Mila, also known as La Pedrera, is arguably one of the most famous buildings designed  by Gaudi.</p>
        <p>The roof features a collection of chimneys and towers that  like they'd fit right in as characters in a Dr. Suess book.</p>
